## 👋 About Me

I’m an IT professional and Master of Business Informatics graduate from the University of Canberra, with strong experience building production-grade frontend applications and data-driven systems. My work sits at the intersection of modern UI engineering, system reliability, analytics, and AI-assisted features.

I currently work as a technical consultant, supporting the delivery of secure, maintainable software and business intelligence solutions. I bring a practical, government-grade approach to development, with a focus on clarity, documentation, and long-term maintainability.

I work effectively both independently and within cross-functional teams, and I value collaboration, clear communication, and delivering outcomes in complex, time-constrained environments.
